# Please-mind-the-mental-illness-gap

Behind the health and economic impacts of the current pandemic, there is a mental health crisis.
The tech workers were less impacted by the economic and health waves since most were able to work remotely and keep their jobs. 
That information is supported by many serious data and also jokes about the number of days it took for usual tech remote workers to discover that the rest of humanity was also confined. 

On the other hand, the mental health crisis should impact them more than other groups since they are usually more impacted by the mental illness than the physical ones. 
Now that we are talking about promising vaccine for covid-19, we should prepare for the reinsertion of millions of mentally impacted persons into workplace and social places. 

I tried to find some information about this reinsertion from the 2020 surveys data made by Open Sourcing Mental Illness since 2014. Open Sourcing Mental Illness is a non-profit corporation dedicated to raising awareness, educating, and providing resources to support mental wellness in the tech and open source communities.
